# GANs
This repo contains some experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks which could be tested on Google Colab.

## MNIST
### Simple GAN
Generative Adversarial Networks with convolutional **Discriminator** and transposed convolutional **Generator** trainned on Google Colab's GPUs for 490 minutes (~8 hours) and 600000 learning iterations to generate MNIST handwritten digits.
Generator creates images from 100-dimentional random vector.
